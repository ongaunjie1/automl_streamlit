Utilizes pycaret to automates machine learning workflows (Deployed at streamlit)

Currently deployed at streamlit community cloud, performance may be slow.
https://automlapp-pycaret.streamlit.app/

Important Note: 
1) The app was created for classification problems and regression problems
2) The app might take a long time to run on the streamlit community cloud due to limited resources available (>=30 min)
   
Other alternatives:
1) Run the source code locally on your computer for faster performance
2) Deploy the streamlit app on a paid cloud service
